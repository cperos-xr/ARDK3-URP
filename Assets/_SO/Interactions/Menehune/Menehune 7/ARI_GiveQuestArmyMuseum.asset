    notificationHeading: Urgent Delivery
    notificationContent: You know, Duke Kahanamoku wasn't just a legendary surfer;
      he lived with aloha, respecting the ocean and everyone in it. Just like him,
      we can make waves with our actions. Speaking of making a splash, I need some
      help. There's someone in front of the army museum. Could you deliver a message
      for me? It's important.
